# Introduction
# Data
Data source: website of [Alliance of Coffee Exellence](https://allianceforcoffeeexcellence.org/competition-auction-results/)
## Data Collection
Data was collected via web scraping, targeting specific pages that provide detailed records of coffee competitions. The extracted data includes:

- Ranking and Scores: Each coffee's competition rank and score.
- Origins and Estates: Details about the coffee's origin and the estate where it was grown.
- Variety and Processing Methods: Information about coffee varieties and their processing techniques.
- Flavor Notes: Descriptions of the coffee's aroma and flavor characteristics.
- Bidders: Information about the bidders, including bid amounts and winning companies.

  

## Data Preprocessing
To ensure the dataset's usability, the preprocessing steps included:

1. Structuring the extracted data into a tabular format.
2. Renaming columns for consistency and clarity (e.g., "Other" was renamed to "Coffee Characteristics").
3. Filling missing data with placeholders (e.g., "NaN") where applicable.
4. Validating and cleaning data to handle inconsistencies in scraped information.
